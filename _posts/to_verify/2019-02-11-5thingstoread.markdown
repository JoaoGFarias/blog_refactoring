# 5 Things to Read

- **[Future JavaScript: what is still missing?](http://2ality.com/2019/01/future-js.html)**
  - Since ES6, released in 2015, ECMA has adopted a policy of yearly major releases for Javascript. To keep up with the whole package every year is hard and wearying, specially if you don't use the language often or deeply. Axel Rauschmayer has one of the [best blogs on Javascript](http://2ality.com/index.html), and has listed some features in the road of the Javascript language, from capacity of comparing values by value to proposals on [pipeline operators](http://2ality.com/2019/01/future-js.html#pipeline-operator).
- **[How do you review test automation code?](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/how-do-you-review-test-automation-code/22071)**
  - Thread on the Ministry of Testing Club on how to review automation code. [Here are my two cents on the discussion](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/how-do-you-review-test-automation-code/22071/3?u=joaofarias)
- **[How to teach Git](https://rachelcarmena.github.io/2018/12/12/how-to-teach-git.html)**
  - Although I find that hands-on, trying-and-error learning is crucial, images and diagrams are great to understand algorithms and tools - specially when they are built under the Unix mindset of modularity. [Rachel Carmena](https://twitter.com/bberrycarmen) does a great work on diagramming basic Git commands here. Bonus: In my first two months of using Git, I struggled due lack of understanding on **how things work**. Then I saw [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY) by Scott Chacon and life simply became better.
- **[Applying the Prime Directive beyond the retrospective](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-prime-directive-beyond-retrospective)**
  - Norm Kerth said "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."; and this goes well beyond the fortnightly meeting we do.
- **[Can't U See](https://cantunsee.space/)**
  - I love finding small UI problems: Misalignments, inconsistencies in fonts and sizes, typos, etc. This "game" gives you two similar images and ask you to pick the _correct_ one. Real testing fun :D
