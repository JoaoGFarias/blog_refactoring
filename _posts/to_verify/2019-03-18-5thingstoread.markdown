# 5 Things to Read

![Reading]({{ "assets/images/reading_time.jpg" | absolute_url }})

- **[Feedspot for Software Testing Podcasts](https://blog.feedspot.com/software_testing_podcasts/)**
  - Although no so widespread as development podcasts, quite a few people out there are doing a great job in giving some radio shows about quality.
- **[Exploring Hypothesis with pytest - Part 1](http://testtotester.blogspot.com/2019/02/exploring-hypothesis-with-pytest-part-1.html)**
  - Pytest is an awesome Python library for random checking - similar to [Haskell's Quickcheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck). Although test design techniques are crucial to have good coverage, it never hurts to have some machine power to unfold some miss edge cases.
- **[Scrum by Example: Product Backlog Refinement in Action](https://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/2019/02/scrum-product-backlog-refinement.html)**
  - Backlog Refinement is maybe the Scrum event where more work is done. "Why?", you may ask. Because a good refinement session makes you **not** to work on things that are not important or shouldn't be done. [Mark Levison](https://twitter.com/mlevison?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) talks about what happen on Refinements.  
- **[Easy Free Automation Part V: Visual Tests](http://thethinkingtester.blogspot.com/2019/02/easy-free-automation-part-v-visual-tests.html)**
  - Although I haven't tried yet, BackstopJS seems to be a good tool for simple visual checking in web apps. Kristin Jackvony talks a bit about it here.
- **[The Web API Design Guidelines for Happy Developers: A short pragmatic guide to build effective and funny Web APIs](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-Guidelines-Happy-Developers-ebook/dp/B019RWDAFS)**
  - I love learning about internal quality: The analysis on **how** things are built. I will start reading this short ebook this month; maybe a post reviewing it in the future. Wanna join me?
