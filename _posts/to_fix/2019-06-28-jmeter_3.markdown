# JMeter Assertions

![JMeter]({{ "https://jmeter.apache.org/images/jmeter.png" | absolute_url }})

Following [our JMeter series](http://thatsabug.com/tag/jmeter-series.html) we are able to create different scenarios
for testing multiple endpoints, [using Thread Groups and Listeners](http://thatsabug.com/2019/06/06/jmeter_1-jmeter_basics.html),
and avoid duplication of configuration [using variables](http://thatsabug.com/2019/06/21/jmeter_2.html).

These tools allow us to evaluate the responses' contents and the time they took to reach us back.

![View]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/view.png" | absolute_url }})

However, unless the server give us some response different than _200 OK_, we will **never see a failure**.

In situations of heavy load, all sort of problems can happen on the server:

- Response's content may be corrupted;
- Specific response can take a long time to return, which is not acceptable for some products.

Additionally, we may want to investigate how the server reacts in situations different from _200 OK_:

- If a resource does not exist, does the system return a _404 response_ fast enough?
- If a server error occurs (_500 code_), does the system continues to work properly?

To answer such questions, it is necessary to run additional validations to each request.

In JMeter, these validations are called _Assertions_.

Let's take a look at some of the simplest, but useful JMeter Assertions.

# Types of Assertions

JMeter offers a vast range of Assertions:

| Type                	| Usage                                                                                                                          	|

| XML Shema Assertion 	| Validate an XML response against an XML schema                                                                                 	|
| JSR223 Assertion    	| Run your own code logic using a JSR223 Script                                                                                  	|

| SMIME Assertion     	| Evaluate the sample results from the Mail Reader Sampler                                                                       	|
| JSON Assertion      	| Execute JsonPath expressions and validate Json documents                                                                       	|
  
For this post, we will focus on Response Assertion, Duration Assertion, and JSON Assertion.

## Response Assertion

The Response Assertion performs content validations on the response, both on the data and meta-data.

Its goal is to detect bad responses generated during heavy server load and stress.

In the example below, we have defined a response validation for all Thread Groups (note the definition on the same level as the Thread Groups).

This Assertion will act (_Apply to_) to the first response (_Main sample_) and re-directs (_sub-sample_), if any.

The validation itself checks if the _Response Code_ _Equals_ to _200_

![Response Assertion]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/response1.png" | absolute_url }})

We can create as many _All-Thread-Groups_ level Assertions as we want.

Below, we are checking if the _Response Message_ _Equals_ to _OK_.

![Response Assertion]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/response2.png" | absolute_url }})

When we run again, all responses continue to be green, because they fullfil both criteria.

![Response Assertion Results]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/response3.png" | absolute_url }})

Let's change the first Assertion to an invalid value, _500_ (_Server Error_ code).

![Response Assertion 2]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/response4.png" | absolute_url }})

Now we see the exact Assertion that failed and the diff between what was expected (_comparison_) and what we got (_received_).

![Response Assertion Results 2]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/response5.png" | absolute_url }})

## Duration Assertion

Duration Assertions investigate the timing the request.

Since this assertion is request specific, it only makes sense to have it under a Thread Group:

![Duration Assertion]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/duration1.png" | absolute_url }})

![Duration Assertion]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/duration2.png" | absolute_url }})

Duration Assertion allows to define the acceptable time threshold for the request, in our
case, we defined 500ms for the Litecoin Orderbook endpoint and 1 second for the Litecoin Trades endpoint.

In case any request fails to meet this limit, JMeter will show a friendly error message:

![Duration Assertion Results]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/duration3.png" | absolute_url }})

## JSON Assertion

JSON is an extension of the Response Assertion.
It aims to facilitate the navigation in JSON responses, in order to do simply integrity verifications
of the data.

In the _Assert JSON Path exists_, we set a JSON path and JMeter will throw an error if this does not exist.

In our case, we want to check that the _asks_ key is composed of a 2-dimensional array: That's why we entered on the first element
of the first element of the array mapped to _asks_.

Additionally, we added a regular expression to match the element found on the path. In our case, I want to be sure we are talking about
a decimal value (at least on numeric value, optionally followed by a dot _._, followed by zero or more numeric values).

![JSON Assertion]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/json_1.png" | absolute_url }})

To demonstrate a failure, I've marked the _"Invert assertion"_, we raises a failure if the regex matches.

![JSON Assertion]({{ "assets/jmeter/post3/json_2.png" | absolute_url }})

With these three assertions, you can investigate further the responses you get with JMeter.

You can see all posts of this JMeter series [here](http://thatsabug.com/tag/jmeter-series.html).

And if you want to try out the resulting suite, you can download it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoGFarias/JoaoGFarias.github.io/master/assets/jmeter/post3/jmeter_test1.jmx).

How would you implement the questions we asked at the beginning of this post?

- If a resource does not exist, does the system return a _404 response_ fast enough?
- If a server error occurs (_500 code_), does the system continues to work properly?
