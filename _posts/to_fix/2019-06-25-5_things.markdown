# 5 Things to Read

![Reading]({{ "assets/images/reading_time.jpg" | absolute_url }})

- **[Micro Frontends - Cam Jackson](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html)**
  - I've first heard of Micro-frontends in 2016, on [an Allegro.tech post](https://allegro.tech/2016/03/Managing-Frontend-in-the-microservices-architecture.html). The idea is to bring the same approach of micro-services to break the frontend monoliths. Cam Jackson does an overview of this on Martin Fowler's blog.
- **[Why keeping levels of abstraction matters - Javier Garcia](https://8thlight.com/blog/javier-garc%C3%ADa/2019/06/11/refactoring-levels-of-abstraction.html)**
  - Abstractions in software are something only seldomly tackled in proper way in computer science college courses. Abstractions are not about _UI_, _Bussiness_, and _Data_ layers. Abstractions are about making the correct questions to each entity in an application. When the app design is focused on placing these questions correctly, we end up with a more testable and extendable codebase.
- **[Principles of Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/)**
  - The lab is not reality. "Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production."
- **[Scrum Anti-Patterns: The Hardening Sprint - Mark Levison](https://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/2019/06/antipattern-hardening-sprint.html)**
  - Anti-patterns are a sign that something can be better. There are moments when things just went south and needs to be fixed; but taking them as a solution is asking for more of them. Agile Principle: "The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."
- **[Database Testing - Kristin Jackvony](https://thethinkingtester.blogspot.com/2019/06/database-testing.html)**
  - Kristin give us some great ideas for investigating changes in a database (no coding here, but testing ideas).
