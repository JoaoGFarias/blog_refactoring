# 5 Things to Read

![Reading]({{ "assets/images/reading_time.jpg" | absolute_url }})

- **[Refactoring the Coding Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMYTwP21dEU)**
  - Awesome talk discussing how to identify developers that can really impact positively your team. Do "Cracking the Code Interview" type of programming challenges reveal problem solvers?
- **[My answer to "Code freeze implementation in #Scrum team?"](https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/36849/code-freeze-implementation-in-scrum-team/36895#36895)**
  - I bit of self-reference now :D. It was asked on the [Software QA Stack Exchange site](https://sqa.stackexchange.com/) how to deal with "code freezes" for testing in teams that use Scrum. How does this concept integrates with agile mindset and the Scrum methodology?
- **[Tests won’t make your software correct](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/12/12/tests-are-not-enough/)**
  - If you verify that your software meets **100%** requirements that do not satisfy user needs, is your software "correct"?
- **[Testers: Get Out of the Quality Assurance Business](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2010/05/testers-get-out-of-the-quality-assurance-business/)**
  - "We are waiting QA to give the green flag for the build" is a phrase that makes my spine shiver - see why.
- **[FP vs. OO List Processing](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2018/12/17/FPvsOO-List-processing.html)**
  - Functional programming can be hard to understand, but when it clicks, it looks like poetry: Each line and function has is a clear step on its own, and they talk to each other smoothly to tell a story, processing data and returning data. Object-oriented programming brings the beauty in the interaction between objects, going up and down on business abstractions. Bob Martin shows this difference with a great explanation here.
