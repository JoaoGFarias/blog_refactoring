# JMeter Variables

![JMeter]({{ "https://jmeter.apache.org/images/jmeter.png" | absolute_url }})

## Where are we?

[On the last post](http://thatsabug.com/2019/06/06/jmeter_1-jmeter_basics.html) we created the foundation for investigating the performance of the orderbook service of [Mercado Bitcoin](https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br), a Brazilian cryptocurrency exchange.

You can download the JMeter suite [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoGFarias/JoaoGFarias.github.io/master/assets/jmeter/post1/jmeter_basics.jmx).

For this post we will start from a more developed suite.

![New suite]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/updated_suite.png" | absolute_url }})

In a summary we have:

* Two Thread Groups: One for the cryptocurrency Litecoin (LTC) and one for Bitcoin (BTC);

* For each Thread Group we will hit two endpoints:
  * _Orderbook_: the list of _asks_ and the list of _bids_
  * _Trades_: A list of all completed trades, with information such as price, amount, and date.

You can download the updated suite [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoGFarias/JoaoGFarias.github.io/master/assets/jmeter/post2/jmeter_variable1.jmx).

# What is the problem?

If you exam closely the new suite we will see that many strings are duplicated in each HTTP Request and Thead Group:

* The Thread Group configuration values

![Thread Group LTC]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_1.png" | absolute_url }})

![Thread Group BTC]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_2.png" | absolute_url }})

* The server name and the HTTP protocol

![Server name]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_3.png" | absolute_url }})

![Server name]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_4.png" | absolute_url }})

* The cryptocurrency name

![LTC]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_5.png" | absolute_url }})

![LTC]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_6.png" | absolute_url }})

* The path (endpoint) we want to hit

![Path]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_7.png" | absolute_url }})

![Path]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/duplicated_8.png" | absolute_url }})

As with any software, duplication is always a code smell: It leads to more effort to implement changes, increases the chance of error, and makes things harder to understand.

Let's solve this using **JMeter Variables!**

# Variables

JMeter allows creation of variables at the Test Plan level.

In the Test Plan tab we can see an area for the definition of variables

![Variables]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables.png" | absolute_url }})

After the definition we can use the variables through the _${**variable_name**}_ notation.

On the Thread Groups:

![Variables Usage]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage.png" | absolute_url }})

![Variables Usage 2]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage2.png" | absolute_url }})

And on the HTTP requests:

![Variables Usage]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage3.png" | absolute_url }})

![Variables Usage 2]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage4.png" | absolute_url }})

![Variables Usage]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage5.png" | absolute_url }})

![Variables Usage 2]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage6.png" | absolute_url }})

And on run-time, JMeter will translate the placeholder notation with the proper value:

![Variables Usage 2]({{ "assets/jmeter/post2/variables_usage7.png" | absolute_url }})

There you have it!
The basic configuration values are defined only once, making our suite easy to understand and change.
